# Parables-and-Pythons
This repository contains supporting materials for my class "Parables and Pythons". The class is from my series of technology and the Bible classes for ages 13 and older. 

There are several ways of using this repository:

* If you want to view the homework files, you can view the files by opening the homework folder and clicking on one of the files. For example, to see the homework for week one, click on the homework folder then click on the Homework1.txt file. This will show you the file contents.
* If you want to view the slides, you can download the slide deck for a given week by opening the slides folder and right-clicking on the slide deck then choosing "Save link as..." (or the equivalent for your browser). You can then open the file from your computer. Note you must have a Microsoft PowerPoint compatible viewer or editor to view the files. If enough people don't have PowerPoint, I may upload .pdf files instead or in addition to the .pptx files.
* (Recommended) If you want to keep up to date on all of the changes to the files in the repository, you can clone it to your computer. See Lesson 2 for details on how to do that.
