1. (2 points) Create a script named ‘rolodex2.py’ that revises (called refactoring) the rolodex assignment at least one function:
    get_record() – gets a record (dictionary) from the user

2. (2 bonus points) Isolate the input() call to a single function:
    get_string(prompt) – pass in the prompt and return a string from the user. Hint: there should be exactly (1) call to input() in the resulting code.

    print_rolodex(rolodex) – print the contents of the rolodex.
