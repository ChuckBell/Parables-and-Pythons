Homework #1

The following is the homework assignment for the first class held on 12 September.

Homework assignments are voluntary, but are designed to reinforce concepts and help you learn Python programming. Doing the homework regularly will be rewarding in two ways. First, you will get a chance to experience Python beyond the classwork. Second, you will earn points to be added to your score for the programming challenge.

Recall, we will be having a programming contest on the last day of class. Any points you earn from correctly completing homework assignments will be added to your score.

To earn the point values assigned, you must complete the assignment and turn it in before the start of the next class. Be sure to write your name on your printout!

1. (0 points) Install Python on your laptop.

2. (1 point) Start the Python interpreter and enter the following lines of code. Print out your screen and turn it in for (1) bonus point for the programming tournament. Use these values: [-1, 13, 25, and 12312313]. That is, your printout should show your Python code running (4) times; once for each value.

num = input("Please enter a number: ")
num_sqrt = float(num) ** 0.5
print("The square root of {0} is {1}.".format(num, num_sqrt))

3. (1 point) For an extra point, save the code to a file and run it as a script and printout a transcript. Be sure to use all four values listed above.

Note: if you combine (2) and (3), you will only receive one point. You must do the steps separately to earn maximum points.

Note: if you use Python 2.7, the outer parenthesis on the print statement are not needed. I will show you how to overcome this issue in the next class.
